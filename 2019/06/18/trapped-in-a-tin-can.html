		<p>It takes a brave soul to leave behind their family to venture into the unknowns and dance with the outer realms of death. Hundreds of young boots slush through the swamps, the song of gunfire fills the morning air. To die for one’s country is the greatest honor pushing these soldiers to perish without fear. Metal birds peck at each other in the air while the hungry war machines scan for enemies leaving no one spared. Each encounter carved deep in their minds just in case they were to survive. Even asleep they take aim for each other’s dreams, every opportunity is a chance to end the war.</p>

<p>The homeland media soon begin to spread their propaganda, stirring fear and anger in the hearts of the people. They paint great soldiers waving a flag to hide behind, romanticizing a war that no one stands behind. The kings put faith in our hearts with their speeches too, reassuring us that our cause is true. While our troops throw away their lives in battle our leaders enjoy a sip from their bottles because in the cold war there are no winners.</p>

<p>This war so long fought soon transforms into a playground of doubt. Comrades lost in battle scream, they will continue to live on in our thoughts. Slowly our lands are filled with mountains of lifeless souls indistinguishable from friend or foe. When fighting halts we soon forget why it even started, making accusations of where the first shots departed. Meanwhile, the profiteers of war sit and count their money feeding off our pain like a bear devouring honey.</p>

<p>The soldiers who come home are often broken and sometimes see an ungrateful country. The flashes of war keep them up at night and even after the battle is over they still continue to fight.</p>
