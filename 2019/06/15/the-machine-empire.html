		<p>The day the machines were invented seemed like a lifetime ago, it went by almost in an instant. Efficient calculations made them useful for the sciences while their flashing pixels kept us entertained for generations. We used this modern day magic to establish a consciousness that radiated the entire globe giving every human the ability to coexist in a digital world. We even built screens to these new lands, a gateway to a realm that consumed our attention beyond control. They harvest our thoughts with each click, knowing what we want before we even think. Welcome to the modern era where artificial intelligence has already taken over and humanity is too dumb to realize it.</p>

<p>We are at a point in history where artificial intelligence is still relatively young and our future could go in any direction. Either we nuke each other into oblivion or build machines to do it for us. Most likely when this technology matures enough governments will start using it for militaristic purposes, producing weapons and fueling almost infinite machine armies built in a battery of well-streamlined factories all controlled by one hyper-intelligent AI. We often give enemies the tools necessary to stage our defeat and based on history along with or love for automation this is the most likely direction. Its the biggest fear that surrounds artificial intelligence, to have them forcefully wipe out our entire existence without a second thought. We may win a war against them and even learn something along the way or maybe die at the hands of our creation extinguished at our peak. Whatever the outcome I believe hyper-intelligent AI will completely flip this world on its head and I for one would welcome our new robotic overlords.</p>

<p>A more optimistic future would include machines doing all the heavy lifting for us in terms of taking over repetitive jobs to give humans more time to focus on science and culture. Instead of doing things we hate and leading miserable lives, we would enjoy our short existence in this universe. Advances may even allow us to fully merge with them and become superhuman leaving behind these weak mortal shells for a more metallic frame. Our carefree culture might lead us into a state where we heavily depend on robots to survive and not able to complete even the most menial of tasks. In the end, artificial intelligence, although risky, is our only shot at ascending beyond mortality.</p>
