		<div class="hook">The wheels of revolution are forever turning</div>
		<div class="article-image"><img src="/assets/the-king-cycle.jpg" alt="Cycle Of Kings"></div>
		<p>A rebel is born with fresh eyes and new beliefs, eager to take hold of their destiny. A revolutionary wanting freedom from the tyrants that rule the motherland, willing to do anything to set their country free. For centuries these royal bloodlines ruled our faith, controlling us with laws that culled the creativity from our minds. The kings we elected cared not for our health but instead for the mountains of their distasteful wealth. Watching our brothers die on meaningless battlefields turned this so-called empire into a breeding ground for rebellion.</p>

<p>Freedom doesnâ€™t come free and the king never plays fair, his armies eclipse the rebellion and he rules his people with fear. The hearts of the masses are sometimes hard to sway but despite this the rebellion grows every day. Strong leaders and motivators soon rise from the forge of oppression encouraging the people to stand against their depression. Soon unlikely allies reveal themselves and coordinated strikes ensue. The king is slain and the capital claimed now we can finally have a prosperous nation. Now the participants would share their prize but gold tends to twist the mind and even brothers would kill each other to have the power to rule another. The once righteous rebellion became corrupt by the blood of greed leaving the last man standing declared the new king.</p>

<p>Now the empire is free from the hands of a truly mad king, the animals that once ruled so mighty have fallen in the dirt, squirming like worms. As the empire accepts its new king, deep in the crowd of cheering peasants a child stands grim. His father died by the hands of the new king and his hateful heart instills rage within him. The cycle of kings again renews, bestowing the throne to someone much worse. Deep in the hearts of many rebels there is a lust to be like the cruel king, a cold leader who seems to have everything.</p>
