		<p>The mind often drifts to a certain abyss when confronted by the terrors of boredom. The joys once lived by times past are eclipsed by the present moment and they soon begin to resemble an endless prison without an escape. Anxiety fills the soul and sweat starts to bubble, the signs of an addiction is the sign of a struggle. The virtual world is often a lot less disappointing than reality. The vivid control you have over your virtual self contrast the chaos that torments everyday reality. From saving the universe from being devoured by fluffy rabbits, to punching trees under the cold purple skies, the realm of video games provide emotions that many be lacking in everyday life</p>

<p>Tendrils begin to sprout and dig their way into our minds, soon an innocent joy evolves into an addiction based on lies. The best years of life pass by and youâ€™ve achieved plenty of riches in virtual reality, but in a dark dungeon free from hope your body waste away in reality. Time no longer holds meaning as the months pass by like days and before you have a chance to react the ones you care about disappear in a haze.</p>
