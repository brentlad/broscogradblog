		<p>Pitch black darkness. I would imagine this was our life before birth, suspended in nothingness and truly at peace. Our modern lives contrast these early beginnings however as even the world we call home was forged in a fiery nest nurtured by chaos. Most of us are born to struggle in the mud lands of our own problems and not many find their escape. Countless get devoured by their demons and those who survive either come out the other side broken or rise to become immortals. This eternal fight is what fueled our species to adapt and achieve greatness beyond comprehension. Itâ€™s a lifetime of mistakes that have contributed to the success of humanity.</p>

<p>The journey is long and we often find ourselves lost in the cruel sea of thought, crafting problems in our head before they have the chance to attack. The overwhelming burdens of life force us to look back at the simpler times when the world seemed open and new. We find innocent babies so adorable as they fumble about trying to exist, I wonder if the gods look down upon us thinking the same thing as we try to understand the complex threads that make up the fabric of reality.</p>

<p>In the end, we all have potential, like a blank canvas we can all grow into a masterpiece. We humans possess a tool that can mold this world into anything. Never in the history of mankind have we had the power to access knowledge so freely and almost instantaneously. The ability to be everywhere and having a voice that echos the globe would be considered magic a few centuries ago. It makes you wonder what this world will look like in the next hundred years. Will it be a paradise or a technological nightmare? Whatever the outcome lets enjoy this blue rock together.</p>
