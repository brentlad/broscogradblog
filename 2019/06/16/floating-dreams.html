		<p>The alarm clock screamed for me to wake from my short slumber, its voice piercing the walls of my inner thought. It was the same cycle every day going to a job that filled my soul with loathe and rage, torturing every atom of my being as each second ticked away. It felt like I was chained to this idea of a honey pot that stood at the end of the rainbow when in fact I could lose this so-called steady job and end up in hell.</p>

<p>The world felt cold; I was a part of a machine that gave me enough to keep the gears turning but never once stopped to ask my name. It was all for the money that’s how they catch the majority, paying enough to fuel our obsession with vanity. I was trapped like a rat in a golden prison selling my soul to impress my cellmates.</p>

<p>At the edge of a cliff and the end of my rope I was given a choice, either keep my job and drift slowly into the realms of insanity or starve to death creating something that I truly enjoyed. Either way, the chance of failure was equal at both ends but at least doing what I loved would allow the ship to sink on my terms. As I lay here on this wooden bench, gazing at the stars, I pray to the gods I made the right choice.</p>
