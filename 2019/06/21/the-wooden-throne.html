		<p>A king born to claim the golden crown, wielding great power able to reshape entire continent. His soldiers were treated as sons in this cruel war and they followed him to the ends of the earth to slay fowl beasts and barbarians to claim glory for the kingdom. His forces were armed with strange magics, firing bolts of fire at their enemies. The enemy forces were mere insects under his boots,a short lived annoyance in his conquest for world dominion.He would instill strict laws upon his people and wiped out anyone who did not fit into the system he designed.</p>

<p>The empire soon stretched its borders across the world destroying vast cultures and ideologies that happened to be in his path. Even the gods sat on their celestial thrones in awe of his magnificent power knowing that one day he would challenge even the heavens.</p>

<p>They called them immortals for they seemed to never die in battle nor bleed when struck by a blade. Their cold eyes peered at enemies with disgust, taking pleasure in curing the world of their species. This was the kings grand design, a perfect army to herald the perfect world. The war would in fact be prolonged to maintain this order, for as long as the people had something to fight there would be no disorder.</p>
