		<p>Time slips past our fingers so easily as the years we cherish go by in a matter of days. That’s the thing with time it seems, as it stops for nobody these days. Not for the king of the world or the peasant in the slums and it seems that regardless of how much time we have it’s never enough. We scream at the top of our lungs cursing at the gods of death that preyed on us before our time, instead getting grim looks of disappointment for our useless lives. A soul without meaning or direction filled with self loathe and spreading its hate among others is only worthy to be placed in the realms of the condemned. Souls such as these normally die twice but not before infecting the world with their spite.</p>

<p>Listening to words of motivation certainly helps, but only for a minute is this feeling of bliss kept. At the beginning of every project we feel a crawling sensation, a horrifying enemy called resistance and temptation. This resistance drives us mad and can be lethal as it traps you in a prison so secure it knows no equal. Before you realise it your entire life has gone by and you wonder what the universe might have given you if you were just to ask. This prison for so many years instilled fear and regret and now you find yourself chained to a death bed. The sad truth is that this cycle will continue even after your death as your sons and daughters take your spot after you are long forgotten.</p>
